      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Plane of Knowledge is a sanctuary where scholars from all over come 
        to learn in peace. The Plane is dominated by the Great Library, which 
        rests on the top of a large hill in the center of the Plane. Within, there 
        are many stacks of books lined with scholars who sell scrolls and books 
        as well as give out quests. The Head Librarian and his Council reside 
        in a room at the very top of the Library.
      <p>Scattered around the library is a bustling city environment. There are 
        three sections, each representing areas of Norrath, although anyone can 
        travel safely throughout the entire Plane. Within each section you will 
        find trainers for various classes as well as merchants selling all manner 
        of goods and supplies. There is nothing that you can't find here.
      <p>Quests are abundant in this Plane, and several local personalities give 
        out several involved quests for high-level players to enjoy.
      <p>Lastly, and probably most importantly, this Plane has portals that will 
        take you just about anywhere on Norrath. They are superior to the ones 
        in the Nexus in that you can travel instantly by just walking up and clicking 
        on them, you are whisked away. It's very similar to the teleportation 
        room in Timorous Deep, except that travel is two-way because you will 
        always be dropped off next to a return portal on the other side.
